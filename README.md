Simple assembly program

## Description of Assignment
Write an ARM assembly language program that counts the number of 1’s for any value in R0. The program must assemble/compile in KEIL and must be able to run in the KEIL simulator. Generally, R0 may contain any value, but for purpose of this exercise, you may move 0x2345ABCD into R0. The number in R0 does not need be preserved. You may use any other registers as you need. The result, total count of 1’s in R0, should be in R1 when the program ends. “
